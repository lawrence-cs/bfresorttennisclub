		"description": "An open space in the south western tip of the village, which is the converging point of Carnival Park Avenue and Margie Moran Street lay 4 abandoned Basketball courts. Un-used, un-lept and exposed to rot under the elements of nature, a select group of sports fanatics saw in it a potential tennis enclave that would partly fulfill the failed promise of 6 lighter Tennis Courts advertised by the subdivision owners."
